                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>
                        3D point clouds represent objects or locations and are increasingly popular because of their ability to recreate reality through spatial coordinates. Efficient compression is critical for reducing file sizes, improving streaming speeds, and enabling high-resolution point clouds in bandwidth-constrained environments. This paper provides a comprehensive comparative evaluation of four major open-source point cloud compression codecs—Draco, MPEG G-PCC, MPEG V-PCC, and Point Cloud Library (PCL)—across 1,211 PLY format files. The study measures compression efficiency, computational speed, and reconstruction quality to determine the best codec for different application priorities.

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        Point cloud compression presents a fundamental challenge: dense 3D point clouds contain massive amounts of spatial and attribute data (including color coordinates), making compression computationally intensive while maintaining geometric fidelity. The irregular structure of real-world point clouds makes traditional compression techniques ineffective. This study required implementing and benchmarking four codecs with entirely different architectural approaches—from simple voxel-based structures to hierarchical geometry-based encoding to video-based projection pipelines.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Codec Architectures</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Draco (Google, 2017)</strong> uses predictive geometry techniques to compress 3D meshes and point clouds, reducing file sizes by 90% or more through efficient encoding of vertex positions, normals, colors, and texture coordinates. It prioritizes transmission speed and storage efficiency at the cost of lossy compression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>MPEG G-PCC (Geometry-based)</strong> organizes geometry into hierarchical spatial structures (like octrees) to represent different levels of detail. This approach preserves fine structure with high accuracy but processes geometry in detail-intensive ways, resulting in slower encoding speeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>MPEG V-PCC (Video-based)</strong> projects 3D point clouds onto 2D layouts compressed using standard video codecs (HEVC). This approach leverages mature video compression technology to achieve exceptionally high compression ratios (1,000-7,000x) but requires computationally intensive projection and video encoding pipelines, often taking multiple hours per file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Point Cloud Library (PCL)</strong> employs octree-based compression with quantized voxel space and occupancy information. It's designed for robotics and real-time applications, prioritizing fast integration and decoding over maximum compression efficiency.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Evaluation Metrics & Results</h3>
                    <p>
                        Three standardized metrics measured codec performance:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compression Efficiency:</strong> Measured via compression ratio and bits-per-point (bpp)</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Total encoding and decoding time; PCL: ~100-200ms, Draco: ~300-450ms, G-PCC: ~500-700ms, V-PCC: 6,467-24,000,000ms</li>
                        <li><strong>Reconstruction Quality:</strong> Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR); higher values indicate more accurate reconstruction</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Key Performance Trade-offs</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Speed vs. Compression:</strong> PCL and Draco complete encoding in sub-second timeframes but achieve weak compression ratios (1-48x). V-PCC achieves 1,000-7,000x compression at the cost of multi-hour processing times. G-PCC balances both, achieving 90x lossless compression with moderate 500-700ms speeds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Quality vs. Efficiency:</strong> G-PCC produced the highest PSNR for PLY folders 1-5 (complex geometry), while PCL showed superior quality on PLY6-7 (extremely dense point clouds where voxel representation aligns well). Draco consistently produced low PSNR scores, indicating noticeable information loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Geometry Complexity Sensitivity:</strong> G-PCC showed strong performance on geometrically complex datasets but quality dropped sharply for ultra-dense irregular geometry (PLY6-7). V-PCC, leveraging video compression, handled dense structured point clouds exceptionally well.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Application-Specific Recommendations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Real-time Robotics & SLAM:</strong> Use PCL for sub-200ms responsiveness in embedded systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Web Visualization & Mobile Delivery:</strong> Use Draco for sub-second processing and moderate compression</li>
                        <li><strong>Balanced Quality & Speed:</strong> Use G-PCC for lossless 90x compression with manageable encoding times</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum Compression (Offline):</strong> Use V-PCC for 1,000-7,000x compression when processing time is not a constraint</li>
                        <li><strong>Large-scale Archives:</strong> V-PCC and G-PCC offer best storage optimization; G-PCC if re-encoding is frequent</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        No single codec dominates across all three performance dimensions. Each reflects a distinct design philosophy:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>PCL & Draco:</strong> Preferred when speed and simplicity are priorities</li>
                        <li><strong>G-PCC & V-PCC:</strong> Preferred when quality and compression efficiency matter most</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                        Effective codec selection requires understanding your specific application requirements and prioritizing which metrics matter most—compression efficiency, computational speed, or reconstruction fidelity. This research provides a data-driven foundation for making informed codec decisions across diverse point cloud processing scenarios.
